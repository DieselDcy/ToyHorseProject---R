# Analyzing a Toy Horse Conjoint Experiment
You are serving as an analyst/modeler in a consulting company—Dandelion Consulting. You are in charge of analyzing a conjoint analysis conducted for a relatively small toy company, EarlyRiders, that specializes in the manufacture of quality toy riding horses with a particular focus on natural materials.
EarlyRiders had a recent management change and realized that their product set was underperforming. They currently offer two products and one in particular was not doing well. The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users. They hired your company to conduct the research. Your company ran a primary data study that focused on a conjoint analysis. Your team has been assigned to analyze the data and create a presentation to give to the management team of EarlyRiders.
The client engagement leader for your company indicated the management team is not very sophisticated in terms of technical skills (little if any statistics background), but that the new management wants to become more business-like in their decision-making. Hence, the main presentation should be pitched for those with only basic knowledge of conjoint, as gained during the proposal phase of the contracting. The engagement leader wants you to do a little (not a lot!) of up-front selling of the technique as enabling more data-driven decisions before jumping into the analysis, insights, and recommendations.
Looking beyond the current client, the engagement leader for your consulting company indicated that there are more small companies that she thinks she can sell this same service to. During that conversation, the CEO asked your team to create a software product that would allow your team (and others) to more easily reuse the software you develop to do this kind of work in the future.
Channel and Competition
EarlyRiders sells their toy riding horses through two channels—local retailers and the Amazon marketplace (and other similar online marketplaces). Historically, most of the sales and profits for the company come from the local retailer channel where consumers are able to feel the quality difference for these much more expensive products. Hence, the conjoint analysis and product line focuses on that channel.
The local retailers generally carry only 3 models because of the size of these products, but there is some variation between retailers. These local retailers mostly draw the segment of consumers seeking natural materials. Within this segment, EarlyRiders has one primary competitor, SpeedGliders, who offer a very limited selection. Beyond this natural materials
competitor, there are also much less expensive toy horse competitors online, but they do not ©2019–2021 Mitchell Lovett. This case was prepared by Professor Mitchell J. Lovett and Neal Burns to facilitate classroom learning. This case is not intended to serve as endorsement, a source of primary data, or illustration of effective or ineffective management practices.

have the natural materials differentiator. So far these cheaper alternatives have not been able to offer a serious challenge to the natural material, higher-end toy horses. It is believed that these online competitors are unlikely to make much headway into the local market in the near future.
Conjoint Study
Your company ran a conjoint study of 200 individuals. This sample is made up of parents of 2-4 year old kids who planned to purchase a toy horse. In the study, each parent had only one child in the desired age range. This sample was developed as a quota sample with equal weights on the 2 year-olds and the 3-4 year-olds. It is believed this sample can represent the population of buyers in the targeted segment.
Each kid-parent pair was brought into a play location and given the opportunity to ride different prototype horses. After the kids played on the different horses for 30 minutes, the parents were asked to complete a short conjoint ratings study conducted via paper and pencil. Each parent rated a total of 12 profiles. They were told to get their children's input as if they were going to make this purchase for their child. The study was conducted at a play location that normally charges for use of their facilities. The parents/children were given access to the location for the afternoon following the study along with some food, but otherwise were not paid. Your team that put the study together felt positive about the overall representativeness
of the sample for the targeted segment.
The conjoint study examined four attributes: price, height, motion, and style. From previous research, these four attributes appeared to capture the most important aspects of the decision that the firm is considering. Other important attributes included stability, total floor footprint, quality of construction, and color/colorfulness. All of these other attributes were made the same in the study, both in the horses the kids played with and in the ratings task. Each factor was manipulated to take on two factor levels. The levels for retail price are $119.99 and $139.99, for height are 18" and 26", for motion are rocking or bouncing, and for style are glamorous or racing. Not all possible combinations of attributes (profiles) were shown to the parents.
In addition to the conjoint data, the gender and age of the child was recorded (Gender=1 if Female, 0 if Male; Age=0 if 2 years old, 1 if 3-4). Management had previously noted differences in styling preferences based on gender and age, and both wanted to confirm and quantify these differences. Further, they wondered whether there might be other differences across end-user preferences that the data might reveal. Such differences might help them tailor the packaging images and locations for advertising and promotional events.

Costs and Profit Calculations
EarlyRiders' new management team is primarily interested in understanding market preferences in order to revitalize their broader product line. The engagement leader indicated that EarlyRider’s management team would like to take advantage of differences across people to design new products or modify existing products to better target segments. The company would like to forecast profits under different product line scenarios using the conjoint analysis. That is, they would like to know the expected profits with their current products as compared to the situation in which they add or modify products in their product line. Ultimately, they are interested in profitability, but long-term profit is their main focus.
Currently, the firm offers two products: an 18" Glamorous Rocking Horse and an 18" Racing Rocking Horse. Both products are priced at $139.99 in the retail channel. The competition is owned by an older man who is directly involved in the manufacturing and is very opinionated about the “right” kind of toy horse. It is believed the competition will be unlikely to expand or change the product offering meaningfully, but might respond by lowering price. The competition offers a 26" Racing Rocking Horse at $139.99.
For this analysis, assume that the total annual market size is 4,000 units, that the variable costs are as depicted below, and that each product in the product line results in fixed costs of $20,000 per year (i.e., for 2 products the cost is $40,000, for three $60,000, etc.). These fixed costs are annual costs and related to leasing the equipment and fixed overhead. Product is made in relatively large batches to achieve these levels of fixed costs. Switching product types with the same number of lines is somewhat costly amounting to $7,000 per new product/switch. These start-up costs are only paid once per switch and relate to designing the cuts, paint colors, materials, etc. Switching price can be assumed to be costless.
For this analysis EarlyRider’s management team indicated you can assume that all retailers offer the product at the suggested retail price and that they charge 25% more than wholesale price so that wholesale prices are $111.99 for the $139.99 retail price and $95.99 for the $119.99 retail price. A significant portion of the product is sold around the holidays, and the standard contracts for these products give retailers 60 days to pay. During the 60-day window, retailers can return product at no additional cost.

Note that the styling does not change the variable costs.

Your Deliverables
Your deliverables include multiple components—a presentation, a short statement of the recommended policy and expected profits, an R file of the software functions to perform your analysis, and a .Rmd file that documents the specific use of the R file of software.
You will use the tools and concepts learned in class and lab to analyze the conjoint data and make recommendations about the product line. You can also provide any recommendations related to messaging, packaging, etc. that arise from your data analysis, but keep in mind that the client’s main focus is on product decisions.
The Presentation:
You have been directed to loosely structure the presentation as follows in order to deliver up to a 7-minute presentation geared toward EarlyRiders Management team. Your up to 7-minute presentation should be recorded and submitted along with a pdf of the slides. You have been instructed to include the following sections in the presentation:
• Executive summary including key insights and recommendations
• Benefit segmentation (a priori and/or post-hoc based on what provides useful insight)
• Market simulations with market share and profit numbers that consider competition
Policy Statement:
Separate from the presentation, you should submit a brief statement of your recommended policy. This policy should be “complete” in that it addresses which products and prices to offer in which situation so that the management team could directly take this policy and use it to determine the product and price decisions. To represent the products succinctly, use the profile number. You can share this with the client, in the presentation, but do what you think makes most sense for the client presentation.
Your policies should be presented as a table like below.
     Name EarlyRiders Offerings
Status Quo P5, P13
SpeedGliders Offering
P7
EarlyRiders Profit (in $1,000s) YYYYY
Competitor’s Profit (in $1,000s)
ZZZZ
          You can indicate any number of offerings and any number of rows, as long as the rows together form a single policy (i.e., they direct action depending on a set of observable conditions). The profits, should be listed in $1,000.

R Software File:
Include a file that has the functions you use with brief descriptions of the inputs and outputs of each function. In particular, for the functions related to the market simulation, you should be able to handle ratings data (ties) and scenarios where a product gains no market share.
Main .Rmd File
This file should contain the record of the work. The file should have four distinct sections. These sections should follow the outline below:
A. Use Regression to estimate the conjoint model at the individual level
• Produce part-utilities to pass to part B
• Produce predictions for missing profiles to pass to part D
B. Conduct Benefit Segmentation via Cluster Analysis of Conjoint Part-Utilities.
• Use cluster analysis on the part-utilities (including the constant)
• Test at least two cluster analysis schemes (i.e., number of clusters) and select the
best one in your view. Justify this decision.
• Interpret the segments in the chosen scheme and identify the ideal product for
each segment
C. Conduct a priori segmentation.
• Conduct a priori segmentation using the variables gender and age in order to profile the attribute preferences based on these variables (use segment-level regressions)
• Test whether these a priori segmentation variables affect the part-utilities. What does this test tell you about these as segmentation schemes?
• If the differences are meaningful, profile the segment-level attribute preferences and identify the ideal product for the a priori segments.
D. Simulate market shares for different product-line scenarios.
• Use disaggregate analysis with a first choice rule to forecast market shares. Using
these market shares and the information about costs in the case, calculate profitability for each product in the product line as well as the overall profitability for the firm and competition.
• You should present at least 4 scenarios that try to identify the best possible product line strategy given considerations related to competitive response, cannibalization, profitability, and long-run profitability.
• Be sure to briefly justify why you chose the scenarios you chose!
